=======================================================================

Transport stream recorder for H.264 streaming devices by Blackmagic Design

Command Line Client
A Command Line based application was added to the repository based on the UI code in MXPTiny. The command line client can be used when a UI application is not needed 
and when more flexibility and finer control of the streaming is needed.
The Command line client application have options to stream to a custom file and/or VLC.
